# Conceptual Design Document: Multi-Agent System

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the conceptual design for transitioning the current AI agent into a multi-agent system. This system will feature specialized agents, an orchestrator to manage tasks, inter-agent communication via task queues, and support for multiple API key configurations. The design draws inspiration from advanced agent frameworks like CAMEL/Owl and aims to enhance the agent's universality and task-handling capabilities within our existing Node.js environment.

## 2. Core Agent Roles and Responsibilities

We will define the following initial agent roles:

*   **`OrchestratorAgent`**
    *   **Primary Functions:**
        *   Acts as the high-level coordinator for user tasks. Receives tasks via the API.
        *   **Planning Delegation:** Utilizes the `PlanManager` component to generate or retrieve execution plans. `PlanManager` is responsible for:
            *   Checking for matching pre-defined plan templates.
            *   If no template matches, constructing a detailed prompt for an LLM (Gemini) based on agent capabilities and the user task (including descriptions of Orchestrator-level tools like `ExploreSearchResults`, `GeminiStepExecutor`, `FileSystemTool` with its operations including `create_pdf_from_text`, and `FileDownloaderTool`).
            *   Calling the LLM service to generate a multi-stage plan.
            *   Validating the structure and content of the plan returned by the LLM.
        *   **Execution Delegation:** Utilizes the `PlanExecutor` component to carry out the steps defined in the generated plan. `PlanExecutor` is responsible for:
            *   Iterating through plan stages and steps.
            *   Dispatching tasks intended for worker agents (like `ResearchAgent`, `UtilityAgent`) to the `SubTaskQueue`.
            *   Awaiting results from worker agents via the `ResultsQueue`.
            *   Directly handling special Orchestrator-level actions defined in the plan. This includes:
                *   `ExploreSearchResults`: Using `ReadWebpageTool` internally.
                *   `GeminiStepExecutor`: For direct LLM calls by the Orchestrator.
                *   `FileSystemTool`: Instantiating `FileSystemTool` with a task-specific, sandboxed workspace path to perform operations like creating, reading, listing files, and creating PDF documents from text (including support for custom TTF/OTF fonts via the `customFontFileName` parameter, with fallback to default fonts).
                *   `FileDownloaderTool`: Instantiating `FileDownloaderTool` with a task-specific, sandboxed workspace path to download files from URLs.
            *   Summarizing data from completed steps (where appropriate) using an LLM.
            *   Aggregating all execution results into a comprehensive `executionContext`.
            *   Collecting `keyFindings` and `errorsEncountered` to update a `CurrentWorkingContext`.
            *   Identifying if a plan step (e.g., a `GeminiStepExecutor` action handled by `PlanExecutor`) was designated to produce the final answer (via an `isFinalAnswer` flag in the step's input) and returning this answer and a flag (`finalAnswerSynthesized`) to the Orchestrator.
        *   **Final Response Synthesis:** After `PlanExecutor` completes, `OrchestratorAgent` first checks if `PlanExecutor` has already provided a synthesized final answer.
            *   If `finalAnswerSynthesized` is true, `OrchestratorAgent` uses this answer directly.
            *   Otherwise, it uses the `executionContext` and the `CurrentWorkingContext` to synthesize a user-facing response, typically using an LLM. This avoids redundant synthesis.
        *   **State Management & Journaling:**
            *   Manages the overall task state, including loading and saving task progress, results, and the `CurrentWorkingContext` object (e.g., using `loadTaskState`, `saveTaskState`).
            *   Orchestrates the collection of a detailed `TaskJournal` by accumulating its own lifecycle events with those generated by `PlanExecutor`. Ensures the complete journal is saved.
        *   Handles overall error management based on outcomes from `PlanManager` and `PlanExecutor`, updating the `CurrentWorkingContext` and `TaskJournal` accordingly.
    *   **Tools It Might Use Directly:** LLM (Gemini) for final response synthesis. (Note: Planning and specific step executions involving LLM calls are now delegated to `PlanManager` and `PlanExecutor`).
    *   **API Key Management:** Configured with its own primary Gemini API key, which is then passed to and utilized by `PlanManager` and `PlanExecutor` for their LLM interactions.

*   **`ResearchAgent`**
    *   **Primary Functions:** Specialized in information gathering. Picks up research-related tasks from the `SubTaskQueue`. Executes tasks using its tools and posts results to the `ResultsQueue`.
    *   **Tools It Uses:** `WebSearchTool`, `ReadWebpageTool`. Potentially an LLM for post-processing results.
    *   **API Key Management:** Configured with keys for search services (e.g., Google CSE) and potentially its own LLM API key.

*   **`UtilityAgent`**
    *   **Primary Functions:** Specialized in performing calculations and other specific utility tasks. Picks up utility tasks (e.g., calculations) from the `SubTaskQueue`. Executes tasks and posts results to the `ResultsQueue`.
    *   **Tools It Uses:** `CalculatorTool`. Future: data converters, code interpreters (sandboxed).
    *   **API Key Management:** Generally no LLM key needed, but specific utility tools might require their own service keys.

## 3. Task Queue Mechanism (Conceptual)

A task queue-based system will manage communication and task distribution.

*   **A. Task Assignment (Orchestrator -> Worker Agents)**
    *   **`SubTaskQueue`:** A primary queue for sub-tasks. Worker agents filter messages by `assigned_agent_role`.
    *   **Task Message Structure (JSON):**
        *   `sub_task_id`: Unique ID for the sub-task.
        *   `parent_task_id`: ID of the original user task.
        *   `assigned_agent_role`: Target worker role (e.g., "ResearchAgent", or "Orchestrator" for special actions).
        *   `tool_name`: Specific tool to use (e.g., "WebSearchTool", "FileSystemTool").
        *   `sub_task_input`: Object with input for the sub-task/tool (e.g., `{ "query": "..." }` for search, or `{ "operation": "create_pdf_from_text", "params": { ... } }` for FileSystemTool).
        *   `context_summary`: (Optional) Relevant context from the Orchestrator.
        *   `api_keys_config_ref`: (Optional, Advanced) Reference to a specific API key profile if a worker supports multiple.

*   **B. Result Reporting (Worker Agents -> Orchestrator)**
    *   **`ResultsQueue`:** A separate queue for sub-task outcomes.
    *   **Result Message Structure (JSON):**
        *   `sub_task_id`: Correlating sub-task ID.
        *   `parent_task_id`: Original user task ID.
        *   `worker_agent_role`: Role of the reporting agent.
        *   `status`: "COMPLETED" or "FAILED".
        *   `result_data`: Output of the sub-task (if COMPLETED).
        *   `error_details`: Error information (if FAILED), including `message` and optional `type`.

*   **C. Initial Implementation:** Queues can be simple in-memory arrays/event emitters within the single `server.js` process initially.

## 4. Inter-Agent Communication Flow & Task Lifecycle

1.  User submits task via frontend to a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/generate-plan`).
2.  API routes task to `OrchestratorAgent`; `parent_task_id` generated.
3.  `OrchestratorAgent` invokes `PlanManager` to obtain an execution plan.
    *   `PlanManager` attempts to use a template or generates a new plan using an LLM (prompt includes FileSystemTool with its operations like `create_pdf_from_text`, & FileDownloaderTool for Orchestrator).
    *   `PlanManager` validates the plan and returns it to `OrchestratorAgent`.
4.  If a valid plan is obtained, `OrchestratorAgent` invokes `PlanExecutor` with the plan and `savedTasksBaseDir`.
    *   `PlanExecutor` iterates through stages and steps:
        *   For tasks assigned to worker agents, `PlanExecutor` enqueues them onto `SubTaskQueue` and awaits results via `ResultsQueue`.
        *   For special Orchestrator actions (e.g., `ExploreSearchResults`, `FileSystemTool` including `create_pdf_from_text`, `FileDownloaderTool`), `PlanExecutor` handles them directly. For file tools, it constructs a `taskWorkspaceDir` using `savedTasksBaseDir` and `parentTaskId`, then instantiates and uses the tool.
    *   `PlanExecutor` collects all results, summarizations, `keyFindings`, `errorsEncountered`, detailed journal entries, and potentially a pre-synthesized `finalAnswer` (if a step was marked with `isFinalAnswer: true`) into its return object.
5.  Worker agents (`ResearchAgent`, `UtilityAgent`) monitor `SubTaskQueue`, dequeue messages matching their role.
6.  Worker agent executes the sub-task using specified tool and input.
7.  Worker agent constructs a result message and enqueues it onto `ResultsQueue`.
8.  `PlanExecutor` receives results from `ResultsQueue` (for worker agent tasks) and combines them with results from directly handled Orchestrator actions. If a sub-task FAILED, `PlanExecutor` may halt execution of subsequent stages and report failure. This is all logged in its portion of the `TaskJournal`.
9.  Once `PlanExecutor` completes, `OrchestratorAgent` receives the final `executionContext`, `journalEntries` from the executor, `updatesForWorkingContext`, and potentially `finalAnswer` with `finalAnswerSynthesized: true`.
10. `OrchestratorAgent` updates its own `CurrentWorkingContext` with the information from `updatesForWorkingContext`.
11. `OrchestratorAgent` checks if `finalAnswerSynthesized` is true.
    *   If true, it uses the `finalAnswer` received from `PlanExecutor`.
    *   If false, it uses its LLM to synthesize a final response based on the `executionContext` and the updated `CurrentWorkingContext`.
12. `OrchestratorAgent` saves the final task state (including `CurrentWorkingContext`) and the complete `TaskJournal` (merged entries from itself and `PlanExecutor`), then returns the response to the API endpoint, then to the user.
